//There is not much difference between .txt and .js file both of them can be treated as source code. Both of them contains text.
//But when we write console, this has a special meaning which is defined inside the .js file
//If we use .js file to be interpreted it'll interpret each line with a predefined set of keywords or syntax and will throw according to that
//If we use .txt file to be interpreted it'll directly throw error by saying 'I don't accept .txt file' or in computer terms 'Invalid or unexpected token'

console.log("Aditya Karki")
